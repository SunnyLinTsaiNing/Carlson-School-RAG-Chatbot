# Trends Marketplace Project
In this project, we leveraged the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to build a chatbot for the Carlson School's website, using Gemini, a large language model developed by Google. This project showcases the benefits of RAG compared to traditional generative AI systems and explores its business applications.
 
## What is RAG?
RAG combines the power of retrieval-based methods with generative AI to provide more accurate, real-time responses by grounding outputs in external, validated data sources.

## RAG vs. Traditional Generative AI

| **Feature**            | **Traditional AI**                | **RAG**                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Data Source**         | Static, pre-trained knowledge     | Dynamic, real-time retrieval                |
| **Accuracy**            | Prone to hallucinations           | Grounded and factually accurate             |
| **Update Frequency**    | Requires retraining for updates   | Instantly retrieves the latest information  |
| **Scalability**         | Limited without costly retraining | Easily scales with external data            |
| **Cost Efficiency**     | High retraining costs             | Eliminates the need for expensive retraining |


## Business Applications
1.	Healthcare: Providing accurate medical advice by retrieving from trusted medical knowledge bases, and assisting doctors in generating summaries of patient histories or relevant medical research.
2.	E-commerce: Responding to customer inquiries about products, warranties, or orders using a combination of real-time data and natural language processing.
3.	Human Resources: Assisting employees with policy-related queries by generating responses based on company handbooks.


## Why RAG Matters for Your Business
1. Competitive Edge: Enables real-time, reliable outputs, keeping businesses ahead in innovation.
2. Enhanced Customer Trust: Provides fact-based answers, improving credibility and confidence.
3. Operational Efficiency: Reduces manual effort with automated content generation and retrieval.

## How RAG Works
1. User Query: A user submits a question or request for information.
2. Retrieval Step: Relevant documents or text snippets are retrieved from a vector database.
3. Generation Step: The generative model uses the retrieved data to produce a response.
4. Output: The final response is accurate, contextually grounded, and factually reliable.

## How We Built This

We followed the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach to build a chatbot for the Carlson Schoolâ€™s website. Hereâ€™s the process:

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Collected relevant information from the website. 
   - Processed the data and embedded it into numerical vectors using an embedding model.

2. **Vector Database Setup**:  
   - Indexed the embedded vectors into a vector database for efficient retrieval.  
   - Configured the database to handle real-time search queries.

3. **Model Integration**:  
   - Connected **Gemini**, a large language model, to the vector database.  
   - Set up the system to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries dynamically.

4. **Response Generation**:  
   - Provided the retrieved data as context to the generative model.  
   - Generated accurate, contextually grounded responses tailored to the query.

5. **Demonstration**:  
   - Used **voila** to create a user interface for showcasing the chatbot.  
   - Conducted thorough testing to ensure reliability, accuracy, and responsiveness during the demo.


**Note**: Due to the complex structure of Carlsonâ€™s website, we manually fetched data instead of using real-time methods. While this limits dynamic updates, future enhancements can incorporate API integration, automated web scraping for real-time data retrieval.
